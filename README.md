# RayTracer
A library for ray tracing. Not very well docmented.
Requires one external dependency, org.json.*, but that's commented out for now.

You can compile it with the makefile. You can also run with make gif, make jpg, make png.
This will run a runnable class called "Main" in the client package, you can edit that how you like.

Use make gif fors gifs, etc.

Right now, running Main will render a 100 frame gif of a ball bouncing with some other stuff. It will save it in the src folder though. Run it with make gif.
